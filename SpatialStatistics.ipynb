    "## Neighborhood Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "For two classes $i$ and $j$, e.g. two cell types, the neighborhood enrichment test computes the number of cells from those classes (i.e. cell types) that are neighbors in the spatial neighbor graph. We denote this number by $x_{ij}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This number is then compared to an estimate of the mean ($\\mu_{ij}$) and the standard deviation ($\\sigma_{ij}$) of a null distribution by randomizing the cell labels $n$ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these parameters, one can compute a z-score $z_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij} - \\mu_{ij}}{\\sigma_{ij}}$, which can then be turned into a p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes on the `squidpy` implementation ([`sq.gr.nhood_enrichment`](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/squidpy.gr.nhood_enrichment.html))**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the p-value is computed via randomization, make sure to pass a seed. The number of randomizations is controlled via `n_perms` and represents a trade-off between robustness/precision and runtime."
